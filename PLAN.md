# PLAN.md: Remaining Tasks for Labours-Go

## üéâ Current Status: **PRODUCTION READY**

The core functionality has been successfully implemented and is working. This document tracks the remaining enhancement tasks.

## Priority: **CRITICAL** üö®

### Testing & Validation

- [x] **Create comprehensive unit test suite** for all analysis modes ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Add integration tests** with sample hercules output data ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Implement visual regression tests** for chart output consistency ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Compare outputs with original Python labours** to ensure mathematical correctness ‚úÖ **READY**
- [x] **Validate chart appearance and data accuracy** across all modes ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

## Priority: **HIGH** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Advanced Analysis Modes

- [x] **Implement `languages` mode** - programming language analysis and statistics ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Implement `old-vs-new` mode** - code age analysis and visualization ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Implement `devs-parallel` mode** - parallel development analysis ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Add `shotness` mode** - code hotspot analysis ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Add `sentiment` mode** - comment sentiment analysis (if desired) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] **Optimize memory usage** for very large repositories
- [ ] **Add parallel processing** for multi-repository analysis
- [ ] **Implement caching** for repeated analysis of same data
- [ ] **Add benchmarking suite** to track performance improvements

## Priority: **MEDIUM** üìà

### Enhanced Visualization

- [ ] **Add TensorFlow Projector support** (--disable-projector flag functionality)
- [x] **Implement custom styling and theming** options ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [ ] **Add interactive chart features** (if feasible with current stack)
- [ ] **Support additional output formats** (PDF, HTML, etc.)

### CLI Enhancements

- [x] **Add progress estimation** for long-running operations
- [ ] **Implement batch processing** for multiple input files
- [ ] **Add configuration file templates** with common settings
- [ ] **Enhanced error messages** with troubleshooting suggestions

## Priority: **LOW** üìã

### Documentation & Polish

- [ ] **Create comprehensive usage tutorials** with real-world examples
- [ ] **Write algorithm explanations** and mathematical documentation
- [ ] **Create migration guide** from Python version to Go version
- [ ] **Add API documentation** for internal packages
- [ ] **Create Docker containerization** for easy deployment

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Add plugin system** for custom analysis modes
- [ ] **Implement REST API** for web-based usage
- [ ] **Add database connectivity** for storing analysis results
- [ ] **Create CI/CD integration** examples

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Refactor shared utility functions** into common packages
- [ ] **Add comprehensive code documentation** and comments
- [ ] **Implement proper logging levels** (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] **Add configuration validation** with helpful error messages

### Build & Release

- [ ] **Set up automated builds** with GitHub Actions or similar
- [ ] **Create release scripts** with version management
- [ ] **Add cross-compilation** for multiple platforms
- [ ] **Implement semantic versioning** strategy

## Notes

### Development Strategy

- Focus on testing first to ensure reliability of current functionality
- Prioritize performance optimizations for better user experience
- Advanced features should not compromise the core functionality
- Maintain 100% compatibility with original Python labours CLI

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Most remaining tasks are enhancements rather than core fixes
- **Medium Risk**: Advanced analysis modes may require significant algorithm research
- **Low Risk**: Current architecture is solid and can accommodate future features
